# Prototype2D



This is an unfinished prototype for a 2D city-building simulation game that is using LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library) with the intention of using a 'custom' game engine.

EDIT: This project has been abandoned, however I encourage everybody to feel free and use it for their own use (learning purposes or for fun). Please note, I did not include the artwork in the repository so you will most likely have to replace it with your own. Have fun!
