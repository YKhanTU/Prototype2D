# Prototype2D



This is a prototype 2D city-building simulation game that is using LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library) with the intention of using a 'custom' game engine.


This game is based on ideas that I have pulled from playing RuneScape, Star Wars: Empire at War, Total War, Banished (an Indie Game), and Rust.
Minecraft comes large into this game as well, even though its prevalent influence may diminish soon enough.
Game of Thrones also inspired this game concept a little bit, most considerably its lore and war episodes (Blackwater, Battle of the Bastards, etc.)

This is oriented around being a 2D city-building simulator that begins at the early stages of Ancient Civilization towards the Modern Era that we live in now.
Your goal, as the city's Ruler, is to sustain a civilization from a mere 'Village' to a large, prospering Nation that promotes trade across the world.
With the ability to build, create an army, and conquer other civilizations, your Nation may run into enemies that may come to destroy your city to dust.



Some features that I have thought about this game were:

- AI Cities or Nations that have a fully sustainable economy, military, and their own form of technological evolution (seeded).
- Trading and Diplomacy (Politics similar to Total War Rome II, and that one free game that I don't remember the name of)
    Finance your city either for its trade, technology advancement, or keeping your citizens happy and safe from war, disease, poverty and so on.
- Combat and Unit Fighting (Similar to SW: EoW and Total War) with unit / target selection, tactics, and so on.
- Direct your units to work specific jobs around the city, as a Soldier, Politician (Diplomat, Tax Collector), Worker (Farm, Resource Gatherer), or Trader.
    Soldiers will have Barracks and they will be able to be posted on 'Guard Duty' in the city's watch tower or gates.
    If you don't have an adequate civilization to have Soldiers or Barracks, you simply post Civilians on 'Guard Duty'.
- Explore the world with your people and establish 'expedition' camps or war camps, based on your intent. You may run into a tribe of
    cannibals, blood-sucking Vampires, Zombies, or another Nation that does not like trespassers. Create roads, trading posts, and even
    hunting camps to provide food to your people.
- Real-time economy simulation - this idea stems off the idea of the Stock Market and how stocks are essentially rising and falling.
    The impact that the rise and fall that these Stocks can impose on an economy can produce interesting effects, such as inflation/deflation,
    mass poverty and starvation, or simply making your own Nation rich. The amount of output your Nation is producing affects this very well.
- Destructible terrain and buildings, influenced by the decisions that you, your enemies, or that Nature brings.
- Evolutionary technology - Just like the history of our own real-world, technology is influenced and expanded over time and knowledge,
    which makes the very civilization that you own vulnerable to new change in terms of trade, war, and sustainment.
- Disease, natural disasters, and a 'real-time' weather system (snow, rain, ash) with numerous effects and possibilities. Citizens in the game
    are all given an age and 'health', which is essentially affected by these negative affects.
- Buff / De-buff system - This is basically stemming off the above feature, which would be influenced by combat, random events, and so on.
    This system will influence the effects of fire, poison, healing, and so on. 
- Random events that affect the game in interesting ways, whether your city finds a chest full of booty, or a meteor crashes into your
    Nation's lands, devastating homes and people.
- Animals (Pets and Wildlife) that each individual 'character' can own, hunt, or simply trade to other people or Nations.
- Character Controlling - As a Ruler, take the reigns of your fellow citizens to explore, fight, or find resources. Control a Soldier or
    other 'NPC' that is apart of your Nation to help lead the battlefield!
- More ideas to come!

Why Java?

    I have been programming in Java since my Freshman year in High School, so I feel like this was a very well-suited project to work on
      in Java. The false assumption that "Java is slower than C++ or other languages" is often spread to people who are interested in
      programming, almost as if Java is a 'stigma' for game and software development. With examples such as Minecraft, 0x10c, and
      numerous MMORPGs such as Star Wars Galaxies (SWG) using it for server-side software, I believe Java is a well-suited programming
      language for any form of application if used properly.
    For this project I am using LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library), which is essentially a 'hook' for OpenGL through Java.

Why is this not Isometric?

    I chose not to do Isometric Artwork for two different reasons:
        - Cost: The Isometric Perspective requires more directions, which means more additional artwork required, especially for Tiles/Characters that require Animations.
                I would rather pay a smaller fee (as I don't even know if I am selling this game or not) for an artist than a large fee.
        - Concept: The concept of this game, although it seems to be well fit for Isometric, looks better without it. Keep in mind this is a Prototype,
                So I am using this 2D Prototype as a concept that may be later used for a second installment that is in 3D (Preferably Unity

Why is the artwork not in this Open-Source Project?

    I decided to leave out the artwork because the artwork I am paying for has just started on the Sprite Sheets for the game.
    I find it more respectable and well-suited to not publicly share the artwork as I am paying for it as a customer and this 'game'
    has no official release date or plans for publishing as of yet.
