Vampires of Gallor
-------------
    This frightening clan of bloodsucking Vampires has made a name for their brutal campaign of
    murdering innocent Humans across the lands, and therefore anyone affiliated with these 'creatures' are looked down upon.

Marauders of Rehen
--------------
    A sensitive and intense brotherhood of marauders and mercenaries that were previously Soldiers. They spend
    most of their time committing crimes and arsony throughout the lands rather than living a traditional
    life in the cities.

Thieving Guild
--------------
    A more or less simple guild of thieves that pickpocket and steal from your fellow citizens.
