- Make it so that Items and Tiles have onActionPerformed function (in Builder Mode or Normal Mode)
- Implement 'ownership' for Tiles (sub-classes in particular), Items, and GameObjects so that we know who owns what.
    The player will have an 'ID' and this will be used to identify who is the owner of what. Or we can just use the instance
     of that class.
